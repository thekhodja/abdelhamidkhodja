Hey, my name is Abdelhamid Khodja! But most people just call me Bioman. I'm a recent Biology graduate from the American University of Sharjah. My research interests include computational biology and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Broadly, I am interested in drug discovery. During my time at AUS, I worked on developing novel antibacterial nanoparticles to create self-disinfecting fabrics.
